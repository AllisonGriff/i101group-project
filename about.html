            <h1 class="zen-dots-regular">About Margaret</h1>
            <h4>Early Life</h4>
            <p class="p1"> Margaret Hamilton was born on August 17, 1936, in Paoli, Indiana, a small town that provided her with a close-knit community and a nurturing environment. She was the middle child in a family that valued education and encouraged intellectual curiosity. Her father, a farmer who also practiced medicine, and her mother, a homemaker, instilled in her the importance of learning and critical thinking from an early age. Growing up, Hamilton showed a knack for mathematics- this subject fascinated her and would become important to her later through work. She attended Paoli High School, where she stood out academically and developed an interest in the sciences. Her high school experience combined with her passion for mathematics, lead her to pursue higher education.</p>

            <p> After previously starting her college education at the university of Michigan, in 1954, Hamilton enrolled at Earlham College in Richmond, Indiana, a Quaker institution known for its emphasis on liberal arts education. Initially, she majored in mathematics but later shifted her focus to philosophy. This approach helped her develop a broader view when it came to problem-solving and critical thinking. During her time at college, she was influenced by changing technology&ndash;like the introduction of computers, which were beginning to become more prevalent in academic and industrial settings. After graduating in 1958, Hamilton began her professional career as a computer programmer. She started working at a time when the field of computing was still begining, and many concepts we take for granted today were still being developed. Her first job was at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where she worked on a project involving radar. This experience introduced her to the burgeoning field of software engineering and allowed her to hone her skills in programming. </p>
                <h4>Career Overview</h4>

                <p> During her time in the meteorology department at MIT, Hamilton worked under the famous mathematician, Edward Lorenz. Lorenz is known as the &quot;Father of the Chaos Theory&quot; who also established the theoretical basis of weather and climate predictability, as well as the basis for computer-aided atmospheric physics and meteorology. Under Lorenz, Hamilton was tasked with creating weather predicting software. Her software contributed to Lorenz&apos;s discovery of the Chaos Theory. While working on software at MIT, Hamilton coined the term &quot;software engineering.&quot; The now popular term was ridiculed and mocked at the time of its creation.</p>
                
                <p>While working alongside Lorenz, Hamilton coined the term "software engineering," a term that was met with skepticism and ridicule at the time. She recognized the need for a more systematic approach to software development, advocating for the establishment of formal processes and methodologies. This forward-thinking perspective helped to legitimize the field of software engineering, which has since become a crucial aspect of technology development.</p>
                
                <p>After her time working in meteorology under Lorenz, Hamilton joined the Apollo Project at MIT in 1965. Hamilton began work in MIT&apos;s Instrumentation Laboratory where she worked personally with other engineers to design the Apollo mission&apos;s guidance computer. Hamilton created Priority Displays error detection and recovery programs. Her technology provided the ability for the on-board flight software to communicate simultaneously (in real-time) with the astronaut working in a network of interconnected systems. This allowed the software (running in parallel with the astronauts) to interrupt the astronauts and replace their normal displays with priority displays in order to warn them in case of an emergency during an Apollo mission. Without her technology, the Apollo mission could have failed in many ways.</p>

                <p>One notable example of Hamilton's innovative approach to error detection was the discovery of what came to be known as the "Lauren bug," named after her young daughter. This issue arose when pre-launch instructions were inadvertently executed during an actual mission, creating a potential crisis. Thanks to Hamilton's foresight in developing a robust error detection system, the problem was identified and resolved before it could impact the mission. Her system was designed to produce outputs that highlighted errors, demonstrating her ability to anticipate problems before they escalated. This incident not only showcased the effectiveness of her software but also underscored her commitment to safety and reliability in the high-stakes environment of space exploration.</p>

                <p> The Priority Displays system enabled the software to interrupt the normal displays and replace them with any critical alerts during emergencies-- ensuring that the astronauts received immediate warnings and guidance. This system was essential for maintaining safety during the missions, since it provided a direct line of communication and support in potentially life-threatening situations. Without Hamilton&apos;s contributions, the Apollo missions might have faced greater risks and challenges, significantly increasing the likelihood of mission failure. Her work not only advanced space exploration but also set new standards for software development and engineering practices.</p>

            <h4>Staying true through adversity</h4>
            <div class=>
                <p> Though Margret Hamilton contributed much to technical innovation and space exploration, she is still not a household name. Throughout history, women&apos;s contributions in science and technology have been marginalized or even credited to men.  Like any woman in STEM from the mid- 20th century, Hamilton worked in a field dominated by men. The achievements of the male astronauts and engineers from her time have often been central to historical recounts and media attention. Her work was often framed as a part of a larger team effort, but her leadership and technical innovations have not been highlighted as much as he male peers. The critical importance of the software that she developed wasn&apos;t widely recognized or understood. In the early days of building space exploration, building rockets and other forms of hardware engineering received far more attention than fields such as software engineering. Her work in software engineering was groundbreaking, but software engineering was not recognized as an engineering discipline.  Despite her contributions, it is not uncommon for women in pivotal roles, like Hamilton, to have less acknowledgement for their accomplishments. While Hamilton eventually received recognition for her contributions, it came much later into Hamilton&apos;s career. Despite her work on Apollo 11 being decades old, she was awarded the president&apos;s Medal of Freedom in 2016. Since then, her contributions are only now being integrated into more comprehensive recounts of NASA&apos;s success stories.  As more companies are paying attention to diversity in STEM, Hamilton&apos;s work is now being more fully recognized, but is still less discussed when you compare her legacy to other figures that worked on the Apollo program.</p>
                <p>In addition to facing misogyny, Hamilton was also a young mother. She often had to bring her daughter to work with her because she could not get any additional childcare. Balancing career and motherhood would be challenging even with childcare support,  so caring for her child every day all day must have been overwhelming. Despite this stressor, Hamilton became one of the main reasons the Apollo project was successful. She made the most of her daughter being with her at work and let her play with some of the simulations at times. On one occasion, Hamilton&apos;s daughter started the simulation and pressed a series of buttons that led to the spaceship crashing in the simulation. This incident helped Hamilton identify some issues that could arise during the real astronauts&apos; trip to the moon.

                <p> Hamilton has been recognized by various professional organizations. In 2018, she was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame- where they celebrated her innovative contributions to software development. In 2020, she was awarded the IEEE Computer Society's Computer Pioneer Award, acknowledging her part in the early development of software engineering practices.</p>


                <p>Looking at her life now, Margaret Hamilton has received numerous awards and has been highly recognized for her groundbreaking contributions to computer science and engineering. One of the most significant accolades came in 2016 when she was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, one of the highest civilian honors in the United States. This award recognized her pivotal role in the Apollo missions and her lasting impact on software engineering. In addition to the Presidential Medal, Hamilton has received several honorary doctorates from prestigious institutions such as the University of Notre Dame and Carnegie Mellon University. .</p>


                <p>These honors have reflected her influence and leadership in the fields of technology and engineering, especially as a woman who broke down barriers in a male-dominated industry. Margret Hamiliton&apos;s legacy will continue through her innovations and mindset. For example, her coinage of the term “software engineer” demonstrates the idea of programming and software development entering other fields. In the future AI could allow for the creation of other fields. Neural network engineering could be a newly created field in the future. Engineers who create and manage large scale neural networks that can solve issues. This flexibility and adaptability to the field of engineering was modernized by Hamiliton&apos;s work to legitimize her term. Another way that Hamiliton&apos;s legacy will continue is through her mindset. Hamilton&apos;s work on the Apollo project was so influential because of her dedication to predicting possible failures and preventing issues before they arose.  Her mindset will continue to influence engineers and problem solvers in the future and her achievements will inspire others to innovate.</p>
